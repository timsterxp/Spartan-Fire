# Spartan-Fire
A prototype application written for iOS devices meant to provide a secure location for SJSU-affiliated persons to access competition information.


Due to the nature of utilizing Google Log-in and Firebase databases and as such with various security keys, source code cannot be provided over github. As noted previously, this is a prototype application and thus information contained in the database is not of importance. The .ipa is provided and will require a device capable of running xCode to compile onto an iOS device.
